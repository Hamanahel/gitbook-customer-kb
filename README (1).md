# Deployment options

As a company, we always recommend Standard deployments. This is because the software suite was designed and deployed in the Standard deployment mode to optimize both cost and speed. Other modes of deployment are provided and outlined as a means to cater to customer requirements.\
\
This page gives an overview of the differences in the 3 modes of deployment. More info about each is available on their respective pages.&#x20;

[^1]: Depends on the volume of business in the region. If HM's volume of business in the region is not big enough to justify a deployment in the region, it will be chargeable.

[^2]: Support for technical reasons that aren't directly connected to the deployment of the service. Ie, custom export of data etc.&#x20;
