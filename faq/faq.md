# FAQ

<details>

<summary>How is Security and Data Encryption Handled?</summary>

Dedicated Database: Your church's data will reside in a separate database, ensuring it's not commingled with any other church's data. Standard Deployment: In our standard deployment, all databases are hosted on a shared database cluster. Dedicated Tenancy Option: If you prefer a fully isolated environment, we can arrange a dedicated tenancy upon request, providing a separate database cluster exclusively for your church's data.\
\
Comprehensive Protection: We employ encryption both in transit and at rest to safeguard your data. This means it's encrypted during transmission and while stored on our servers. \
\
Reliable Platforms: Our databases are deployed on industry-leading cloud platforms, Azure and AWS, which offer robust security measures.\
\
Access to the Database: Strict Access Controls: Only authorized management personnel have direct access to the database, which is located within a secure virtual private cloud (VPC). Development Processes: Our development team works on separate staging resources, and any changes are thoroughly reviewed by management before being implemented in production.&#x20;

Limited Data Sharing: In rare cases where production data is essential for troubleshooting, we provide redacted database dumps to the development team, typically sharing only 10% of the data.&#x20;
