# On-prem deployments

### Brief

On-prem deployments are unmanaged deployments are deployed on the client's premises on supporting hardware purchased by the client.&#x20;

### Service Outline

The deployment is configured to run an L1 hypervisor on the device and deploy the services are VM(s) on the server.&#x20;

### Backups

Snapshot backups are taken periodically. Period to be set up client. Encryption can be enabled on these backups and a lifecycle/workflow can be implemented to ensure safety.

### Restarts

To protect the IP of the company, VM(s) used in on-prem deployments run in full disk encryption mode and hence would require support from our end to assist with server restarts. We provide 6 complimentary restarts a year during office hours (0900 - 1800 IST).

### Internet access and Mobile app support

While on-prem deployments are often used for direct access to the service and not over the internet, we support them in our deployments. As long as the internet is reliable, we can configure the same.

### Notes on Hardware vendors

Hamanahel does not directly engage itself as a hardware vendor and currently does not endorse other vendors and as such cannot assist clients in this regard. We can however work with your vendors to let you know the requirements we need for an on-prem server.
