# Air gapped deployments

### Brief

Air-gapped deployments are an extension of on-prem deployments and the only difference is that there is no Internet connectivity to the machine.

### Service Outline

The deployment is configured to run an L1 hypervisor on the device and deploy the services are VM(s) on the server.&#x20;

### Backups

Snapshot backups are taken periodically. Period to be set up client. Encryption can be enabled on these backups however lifecycle/workflows are not possible outside of the server.

### Restarts

To protect the IP of the company, VM(s) used in on-prem deployments run in full disk encryption mode and hence would require support from our end to assist with server restarts. We provide 6 complimentary restarts a year during office hours (0900 - 1800 IST).

### Internet access and Mobile app support

While on-prem deployments support access over the internet and the use of the mobile app, it's not possible in air-gapped mode.

### Notes on Hardware vendors

Hamanahel does not directly engage itself as a hardware vendor and currently does not endorse other vendors and as such cannot assist clients in this regard. We can however work with your vendors to let you know the requirements we need for an on-prem server.
