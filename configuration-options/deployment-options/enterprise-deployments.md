# Enterprise deployments

### Brief

Enterprise deployments are managed deployments provisioned on vendor platforms as per the specifications of the client. These are employed in situations wherein the client is required to comply with statutory requirements that are beyond the scope of Standard deployments. A classic example is the use of a local data center to help comply with the UK GDPR requirements.\
\
The deployment is done on a dedicated cloud account opened for the client and while Hamanahel charges a setup fee and deployment fees annually, the cost of Infrastructure is billed at cost.\


### Regions

Enterprise deployments can be deployed with any cloud vendor providing VPS services. However, we do recommend using AWS or at least vendors with managed RDBMS services like Amazon RDS.\


### Backups

Backup policies are as per the client's requirements.
