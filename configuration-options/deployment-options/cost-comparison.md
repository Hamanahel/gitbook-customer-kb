# Cost comparison

Charges marked as external are those charged by the Vendors contracted by the Client. They are values estimated based on what we've seen our clients pay in the past. We make no commitments toward the accuracy of those values. They are provided for reference.



Assumptions

1. SYS-5019S-L server from Supermicro
2. The running cost of servers such as power, backup, and internet have been ignored as these are hard to estimate
3. Service AMC on the server is calculated at 18% per year
